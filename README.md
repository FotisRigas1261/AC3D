# AC/3D Bioinformatics Tool README


## Introduction
AC/3D is a bioinformatics tool designed to provide context and 3D visualization for proteins with acetylated lysines. 


## Features

### Input Options
This tool takes as input a protein by Uniprot ID or CPLM ID (gene name can also be given, a choice between uniprot IDs can then be made).

### Output Database
The output is a database containing information about secondary structures and for the acytelated lysines: accessibility, distance to binding sites, conservation scores, known mutations.

### Platform Support
- **Backbone Dynamics:** Linux is required for supporting backbone dynamics.
