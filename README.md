AC/3D is a bioinformatics tool that provides context and 3D visualization for proteins with acetylated lysines.  

This tool takes as input a protein by Uniprot ID or CPLM ID (gene name can also be given, a choice between uniprot IDs can then be made).
The output is a database containing information about secondary structures and for the acytelated lysines: accessibility, distance to binding sites, conservation scores, known mutations.

Backbone dynamics are only supported on linux.
